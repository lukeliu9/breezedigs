<div class="no-results">

<h3>Here are a few reasons why:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>If you are looking for a specific building, we may not have it in our database yet. You can add a new building <%= link_to "here", new_building_path %></p></li>
	<li><p>If you tried a city, zip code, area, or neighborhood, we may not have any buildings in the geographic area you searched for. You can add a new building <%= link_to "here", new_building_path %></p></li>
	<li><p>There may be multiple instances for the city/area/neighborhood you searched for - try a different attribute like a zip code or street name</p></li>
	<li><p>If you searched by address, try searching without abbreviations (ie, "Drive instead of "Dr")</p></li>
	<li><p>If you are searching by zip code, please use just the five-character base zip code (ie, 60601 instead of 60601-4722)</p></li>
</ul>
